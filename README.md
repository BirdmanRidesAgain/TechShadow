## Vision statement
Whether it has been part of a career path transition, a switch to a new company, or even a change from one development team to another in the same company, we have all wished we had the opportunity to see if the grass actually is greener on the other side. TechShadow allows its users the opportunity to see first hand, in a stress free environment, what a day in the life of a developer truly entails, so that they can make confident informed decisions about that next career move.

## Motivation
Each member of this team has expressed that they would have benefited from a tool like TechShadow in their own lives. I think we are all excited to bring this product to life so that others (or even ourselves) can benefit from it in their future career decisions.

## Risks to completion

- Highly asynchronous team
- Uneven spread of skills across team members (scripting, back-end, front-end)
- Limited communication and live coordination time (Weekly v. Daily)
- Competing priorities for team members (Work, School, Family, etc.)

### Mitigation strategy
1.  **Asynchronous team** - While this team has a high level of geographic distribution, with no two team members residing in the same time zone, we anticipate this risk to be minimal. Throughout the last few years, most have become accustomed to working in a distributed environment and have adapted to utilizing tools that facilitate this practice. We have adopted Slack as our primary communication tool, allowing team members to react to discussions on their timelines. Additionally, we have discussed the requirement to plan far enough ahead of deadlines, due dates, etc. to provide team members ample room for some delay in communication.
2.  **Varied skill sets and experience** - We view this as a low risk. Through discussion, we have identified the areas in which each team member feels most and least strong in their abilities. We have agreed that a pair programming approach will provide us the opportunity to give those seeking more experience on a particular topic the ability to gain that experience without sacrificing the ability to produce working code quickly and efficiently. Additionally, our team’s wide breadth of skills may actually work as a strength as in most circumstances we should have someone with moderate to high level of experience in any given subject.
3.  **Communication and minimal live coordination** - We view this as a moderate risk. Typically agile teams have the opportunity to meet daily and thus can pivot rapidly to avoid blockers, delays, etc. With our inability to meet in a ‘live’ setting more than once a week this becomes more challenging. We believe that using Slack and Trello as communication and coordination tools will help mitigate this risk. 
4.  **Competing priorities** - We view this as a moderate to low risk. As a team we have discussed that each of us has many, sometimes inflexible, competing priorities that could impact our ability to meet individual goals in a timely manner. We have all agreed that we are willing to share workload and pick up additional slack as necessary to ensure that all team goals are met, as long as each team member needing assistance provides as much warning and time to plan as possible.

## Development method
Scrum
